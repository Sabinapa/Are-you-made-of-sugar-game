# Welcome to the "Are you made of sugar?" Game

**Game Dynamics:**

"Are you made of sugar" is an engaging and fast-paced game that challenges your reflexes and skills. 
In this game, you control a cute sugar cube hero moving left and right. Your objective is to dodge falling raindrops that appear randomly on the screen. Your hero must stay in the game for as long as possible without getting hit by the raindrops.
However, increasing the number of raindrops diminishes his life, thereby challenging him to collect as many ice creams as he can within this time frame to maximize his points.

**Game Mechanics:**

The game is played using your keyboard. Use the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to move the sugar cube and avoid the falling raindrops. Additionally, you can use the space bar to trigger a special action (e.g., shooting). Collect the ice cream that randomly appear to earn extra points.

**Game Mechanics:**

- Sugar Cube Hero: Your in-game character, a sugar cube in the shape of a hero.
- Waterrops: These fall from the sky, and your goal is to avoid them otherwise you will lose health.
- Ice Cream: Collect these to score points as they appear randomly among the raindrops.
- Health: You start with a 100 health, which decrease if waterdrops hit you.
- Points: Earn points each time you collect an ice cream.
- Game Over: The game ends when you run out of health.

Enjoy the game and collect as many points as possible and aim to beat your best score.

This exciting game, created using Java and the LibGDX framework, is currently under development as part of my university project, and it's being crafted in Android Studio
