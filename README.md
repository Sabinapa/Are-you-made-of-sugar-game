**Game Dynamics:**

"Are you made of sugar" is a cute game that challenges your reflexes and skills. 
In this game, you control a cute sugar cube hero moving left and right. Your objective is to dodge falling raindrops that appear randomly on the screen. Your sugar must stay in the game for as long as possible without getting hit by the waterdrops.
However, increasing the number of raindrops diminishes his life, thereby challenging him to collect as many ice creams as he can within this time frame to maximize his points.

**Game Mechanics:**

The game is played using your keyboard. Use the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys to move the sugar cube and avoid the falling raindrops. Additionally, you can use the space bar to trigger a special action (e.g., shooting). Collect the ice cream that randomly appear to earn extra points.
